# wordWad

A Choose your own adventure app developed by Steven Henke, Ryen Goldsmith, Jack Morrissey, Thomas Fitzer, and Zack Cozine.

Remember those Chosse Your Own Adventure books you used to read in your youth? Well, here is the adult and online version.  Pick a wad (story) and choose you own adventure one post at a time, or create an entry at any point in the story. The adventure is yours to follow or create.

## Planned updates

This app is still being developed, and is not yet at minimum viable product status. 

What's working:
* User authentication
* Able to submit a story and have it post to mySql.  Then use handlebars to pull information from database to display new stories.

What still needs to be fixed:
* Displaying stories to the storyFrag page:   We're having trouble inserting the primary Key from the Stories Table to the Entry table.
* Linking the three options to the new story.
